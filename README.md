## Hi I'm Hiba 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student graduating in **June 2026**, passionate about building interactive systems. 😄

⚡ I'm currently working on an AI Powered AR Basketball Training Tool, a simulation system that transforms a coach's basketball tactic drawing video into interactive 3D visualization using **Unity C#** and **Google Gemini**.

💬 My career started in frontend engineering, where I worked on designing and developing user interfaces. Later, I joined **BMW Group** as a Software Engineer Intern for 6 months, where I worked on 3D simulation and full-stack applications for the logistics planning department.
